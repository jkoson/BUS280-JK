"If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women’s rights and women’s rights are human rights once and for all. Let us not forget that among those rights are the right to speak freely -- and the right to be heard."

"Women must enjoy the rights to participate fully in the social and political lives of their countries, if we want freedom and democracy to thrive and endure."
